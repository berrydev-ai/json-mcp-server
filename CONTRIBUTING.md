3. **Testing** - Reviewers may test changes in different environments
4. **Approval** - Once approved, changes are merged to main

## Coding Standards

### JavaScript Style
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+) features
- Follow existing code formatting and conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Handle errors gracefully with detailed logging

### File Organization
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js           # Main server implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test.js           # Test utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json      # Dependencies and scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile        # Container definition
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ examples/         # Docker Compose examples
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/            # Additional documentation
```

### Environment Variables
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Document all variables in CLAUDE.md
- Obfuscate sensitive values in logs

### Error Handling
```javascript
// Good: Detailed error handling
try {
  const result = await riskyOperation();
  return result;
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Operation failed: ${error.message}`, {
    operation: 'riskyOperation',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    details: error.stack
  });
  throw new Error(`Failed to complete operation: ${error.message}`);
}
```

### Logging
- Use transport-aware logging (console.log for HTTP, console.error for stdio)
- Include timestamps and context
- Obfuscate sensitive information
- Use appropriate log levels

## Testing Requirements

### Local Testing
```bash
# Basic functionality
npm test

# Server startup
npm start -- --verbose=true

# HTTP transport
npm run start:http

# MCP Inspector
npm run inspect:local
```

### Docker Testing
```bash
# Test all variants
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps
docker-compose logs

# Health checks
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:3001/health
curl http://localhost:8081/health

# Cleanup
docker-compose down
```

### Integration Testing
When adding new features, ensure they work with:
- Both stdio and HTTP transports
- Various authentication configurations
- S3 synchronization (if applicable)
- Different environment variable combinations

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document public APIs and complex functions
- Include usage examples
- Explain non-obvious business logic
- Update CLAUDE.md for new development commands

### README Updates
Update README.md when adding:
- New features or tools
- Configuration options
- Usage examples

## Security

### Reporting Vulnerabilities
- **DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities
- Email security concerns to the maintainers
- Include detailed information about the vulnerability
- Allow time for the issue to be addressed before public disclosure

### Security Best Practices
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Validate all user inputs
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies updated

## Release Process

Contributors can suggest releases, but only maintainers can create them:

1. **Version Bumping** - Follow semantic versioning
2. **Changelog Updates** - Document all changes
3. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing before release
4. **Tagging** - Create git tags for versions
5. **Publishing** - Automated via CI/CD pipeline

## Questions and Support

### Getting Help
- Check existing documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md, DEVELOPMENT.md)
- Search existing GitHub issues
- Create a new issue with the "question" label
- Join community discussions

### Contact Information
- **GitHub Issues** - Primary communication channel
- **Maintainers** - Available via GitHub mentions
